# Item Writing
Public facing Item Writing development repository for the Node.js Certified Developer exam  

*This repository is a reflection of project work collaborated on in private repositories to maintain the integrity of the exam questions.*

The Item Writing development is being held as a series of online, distributed webinars and collaborative video sessions to allow for global contribution. There are 30 item writers--one per question. A smaller subset of these folks comprises the Item Writing Review Team(IWRT). This group, 12 people, is responsible for reviewing items written, honing unsatisfactory items, and holding consensus/leveling meetings with the other members of the IWRT to finalize the question set. We're aiming for item writers to not be able to view questions in progress outside of the domain to which they are working on, so that they can remain eligible to be certified if they wish to do so. The IWRT will more likely be exposed to enough questions that this will be difficult to allow.

Time commitment for the Item Writing team: 
- 1.5 hour intro webinar to learn the format and how to write the question(s)--item writers & IWRT
- 2 to 5 hours independently writing and reviewing the question with Item Writing Review Team members--items writers & IWRT
- 5 to 6 1-hour online meetings to reach consensus, group review, and level items--IWRT only

### ITEM WRITING
Item writing development occurs in GitHub and is tested in a sandbox within the HackerRank infrastructure, where the in-browser hosted Node.js environment will live for the Node.js Certified Developer exam. We’ll be backing up all items as private repositories in GitHub. A repository has been established with tight permissions to account for atomic work and allow for item writers to not be exposed to so many exam items that they themselves could not certify.

#### The Questions

There will be a total of 32 items on the Node.js Certified Developer exam. We will have 5 variants of the exam overall. This allows for reducing exposure and potential cheating on the exam. 
  
We will have 10 anchor items, the same on all exams.  
We will need 22 unique items on each form.

Item writers will create one question with 4 variants.
  
Item writers, along with Item Writing Review Team members, will submit their items via a fork and pull model. IWRT members will review and comment on submitted items for consistency
